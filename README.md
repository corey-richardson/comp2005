This is the template for your COMP2005 Assessment. It uses a single repo for both parts (projects), and the repository therefore has 2 folders (which you must not rename):

- `part-a-web-service-api` (put your Web-Service-API submission for Part A here)
- `part-b-fontend-app` (put your Frontend-App submission for Part B here)

Refer to the brief document for details regarding what is required in each of these.

Each folder also contains a `.gitignore file`, which should prevent unnecessary (temporary) files being committed (specific to Java, which is required).
